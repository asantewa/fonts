<p>Balinese is a language of the Austronesian family of languages, ostensibly
spoken by about three million people on the island of Bali, Indonesia, and
among some Balinese immigrant communities on other Indonesian islands.
</p>

<p>Balinese script, or Aksara Bali, is an abugida that was derived from the
Old Kawi script, which ultimately derived from the Brahmi script, the root of
all the Indic and Southeast Asian scripts. The earliest known inscriptions
were from the 11th century AD. An abugida, also known as an alphasyllabary, is
a segmental writing system in which consonant vowel sequences are written as a
unit. In the case of Balinese, each character is comprised of a consonant
along with the vowel “a.”</p>

<p>There are now two fonts available for Aksara Bali: Bali Simbar Dwijendra, developed by I Made Suatjana 
written in Visual Basic which uses the program Keyman to manipulate the keyboard for Microsoft Word; 
and Bali Galang Smart Font, developed by Donny Harimurti and his sons, 
which can only be used with applications which are integrated with the Graphite engine 
(for example, Firefox with Graphite enabled, and Open Office).</p>
