<p>UnifrakturCook is a blackletter font. 
It is based on Peter Wiegel’s font <a href="http://www.peter-wiegel.de/KochFraktur.html">Koch fette deutsche Schrift</a> 
which is in turn based on a 1910 typeface by Rudolf Koch. 
While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel’s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturCook uses smart font technologies for 
displaying the font’s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). 
An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept 
when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased.

<p>UnifrakturCook is optimized for @font-face linking on the internet by combining standards compliance with a permissive license.</p>
