<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Londrina+Outline">Londrina Outline</a>, 
and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Sketch">Londrina Sketch</a>. 
It is a fairly square-shaped display type with a handwritten feel.

The main style - Londrina Solid is a bold version and can be combined with the others to create different effects.

The origins of the Londrina typeface project is in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil: Urban confusion. 
Initially designed for use in a poster, with only uppercase letters, the potential for it to be a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing
used day-to-day in Sao Pauloâ€™s informal communication, developed the font into a typeface family with lowercases too. 
The variety in texture allows you to create different projects from posters to magazines and t-shirts etc.
