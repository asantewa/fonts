<p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin">Cabin</a> Font is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston’s and 
Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism.<p>
<p>Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans.</p> 
<p>This is the Sketch version, with the texture of a teenage doodle.
There's also a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin+Condensed">Condensed</a> version.</p>
