Actor was designed as a thesis project at the Aachen University of Applied Sciences at Karl-Friedrich (Kai) Oetzbach.

Actor has a strong x-height, which is why it always requires a fairly high line spacing. 
The digits of Actor are created as old style figures. 
The forms of 6 and 9 are more dynamic and more tense than usual. 
The 8 has significantly shifted interiors and the 7 is slightly curved to the left.
