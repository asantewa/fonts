Just Me Again Down Here was created a few weeks after Kimberly Geswein and her family moved to China, using a Wacom Tablet and Adobe Illustrator.

This is her “messy” handwriting with mixed capitals and irregularities. 
After moving to China and finding herself unable to communicate in her new home country’s language, 
creating a font was something that reminded me that she did know how to do <em>something</em> and in spite of it, 
she would survive those first confusing weeks abroad.
