Shrikhand supports the Gujarati and Latin writing systems. 
The name (શ્રીખંડ) is a sweet and creamy Gujarati dessert that is a particular favourite of the designer, Jonny Pinhorn.

Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen 
on the streets in Gujarat. 
Big, bold, and unapologetic, Shrikhand is a display type that evolved from discussions with colleagues about how good 
the Gujarati script looks when it is free to be as curvaceous and expressive as possible.
