Libre Caslon Text is a typeface specifically tailored to be used for web body text.
It based on the hand lettering artist – Caslon’s interpretations, that were typical of 1950s advertising. 
In comparison to lots of digital Caslon's revivals, and lots of Caslon-esque fonts, Libre Calson Text looks very good when printed on paper and 
is also suitable for web body text, achieving good legibility in both instances.

It includes a set of OpenType features and a big Pro character-set covering 103 Latin languages.
