Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers. 
The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.

Starting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a complete extended Cyrillic set.
