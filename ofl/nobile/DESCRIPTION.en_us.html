"Nobile" is designed to work with the technologies of digital screens and handheld devices 
without losing the distinctive look usually found in fonts designed for printing. 
Referencing William Morris's baseline - "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful", 
the aim was to design a font that could function well, have good legibility on screen and be good looking, 
not only at larger display sizes but at small text sizes as well.
