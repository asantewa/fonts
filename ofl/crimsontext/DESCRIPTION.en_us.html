<p>Crimson Text is a font family for book production in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces.</p> 
<p>There are a lot of great free fonts around, but one kind is missing: those Garamond-inspired types with all the little niceties like 
oldstyle figures, small caps, fleurons, math characters and the like. 
In fact, a lot of time is spent developing free knock-offs of ugly "standards" like Times and Helvetica.</p> 
<p>Crimson Text is inspired by the fantastic work of people like Jan Tschichold, Robert Slimbach and Jonathan Hoefler. 
The hope is for the free type community to enjoy Crimson Text as a beautiful workhorse.</p>

A newer version, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro">Crimson Pro</a>, designed by Jacques Le Bailly is available. </p>
