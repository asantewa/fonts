Nunito is a well-balanced geometric sans serif that is suitable for both body text and headlines. 
What makes Nunito a dynamic typeface is its tall x height and rounded corners - making for great legibility.

The project began with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito">Nunito</a>, 
which was created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. 
Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans.
