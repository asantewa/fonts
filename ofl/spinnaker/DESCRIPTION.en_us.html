Spinnaker is based on French and UK lettering found on posters made for travelling by ship. 
It is a low contrast and slightly wide sans serif design, with a youthful sense of whimsiness combined with the 
expected utility that a sans serif commonly offers.
Spinnaker is suitable for use in medium to large sizes.
