Designed to integrate with the character of the Mozilla FirefoxOS, the Fira typefaces also aim to cover the legibility needs 
for a large range of handsets varying in screen quality and rendering.
</p>
<p>The Fira font family comes in 3 other styles 
(<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans+Condensed">Fira Sans Condensed</a>, 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans+Extra+Condensed">Fira Sans Extra Condensed</a> 
and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code">Fira Code</a>), 
with different weights and accompanied by italic styles.  
The package also includes a <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Fira+Mono">Mono Spaced variant</a>.
