Waiting for the Sunrise is based on the handwriting of a high school student. 
The title comes from the song <a href="http://theafters.com/music/">Lift Me Up by The Afters</a>. 
Although this font was created during a time of darkness in designer Kimberly Gesweinâ€™s life, it is a cheery, perky font. 
It is a reminder of the joy that comes after mourning.
