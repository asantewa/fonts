Russo means Russian. For a font named Russian, it seems strange that there is no snow, vodka or bears. 
The idea was to show the varied and modern culture of Russia. In Russia, too, there is love for good fonts and typography.
Russo One is designed for headlines and logotypes. It is simple and original,
stylish and casual.

Russo One is a Unicode typeface family that supports
languages that use the Cyrillic, Baltic, Turkish, Central Europe, Latin script
and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.
