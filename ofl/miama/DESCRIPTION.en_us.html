<em>Miama</em> is based on the handwritten letters of the designerâ€™s girlfriend. 
Among them are also some ligatures and ornamental glyphs.
</p>
<p>Every single glyph has been drawn by myself using the free font editor FontForge.
</p>
<p>Do not use any condensed nor extended spacing! <em>Miama</em> lives from
connected strokes, which are killed as soon as you change spacing.
</p>
<p>Use <em>Miama</em> for main titles, short poems, greeting cards, wedding
stuff et cetera.
</p>
<p>
<em>Miama</em> is a very small typeface compared to other fonts. This is due to the very large ascenders and
descenders. So if you want to look at <em>Miama</em> as a font of 10pt, choose
15-20pt. Also keep in mind, to resize it even more when using it for titles.
