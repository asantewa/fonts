Halant is a typeface family supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. 
This is an Open Source font family, first published by the Indian Type Foundry in 2014.
This typeface design is well-suited for setting long continuous texts. 
The Halant family includes five weights, from Light through Bold. 
Each font has 928 glyphs, including all of the unique conjunct forms necessary for Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, etc.
The shape of the Devanagari characters in the Halant fonts are traditional in appearance — 
they are based on writing and calligraphic principles – which significantly aids their readability.

The Devanagari glyphs in the Halant project were designed by Vivek Sadamate and Ninad Kale. 
The Latin is by Jonny Pinhorn.
