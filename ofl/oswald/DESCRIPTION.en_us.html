Oswald is a sans serif typeface that is synonymous to well-honed and acutely refined. 
Every curve and angle of the letterform is finely adjusted to give it a visual balance that makes for pleasant reading.

<p>
From advertising and packaging to editorial and publishing â€“ it is a typeface intended for a range of uses.

<p>
In January 2019, it was updated with a Variable Font "Weight" axis.
