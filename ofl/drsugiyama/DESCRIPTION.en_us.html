The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. 
The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created by Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - 
is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

Dr Sugiyama is a casually written brush script, with uniform thick and thin strokes. 
The entire collection is made up of elegant hand lettering fonts, perfect for formal invitations, product packaging and editorial needs.
