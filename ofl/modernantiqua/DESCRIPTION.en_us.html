Modern Antiqua font, created by Wojciech Kalinowski around 1995 at the onset of him doing inscriptions on stone professionally, 
is a humanist typeface with characteristics that look like they were designed with the human hand.  
Initially it contained only capitals and digits, lowercase and symbols were added later. 
Modern Antiqua can be used for editorial, taglines and packaging needs.
