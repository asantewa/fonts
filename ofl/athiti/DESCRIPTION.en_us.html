Athiti is a Thai word for the Sun, and it is an informal sans Latin and loopless Thai typeface. 
The friendly personality is based on humanist calligraphy, and has an organic look and feel while preserving the traditional construction of Roman type. 
It is designed to reflect a trace of writing tools and convey its inspiration. 
The family consists of 6 weights that can be used in headlines or body text.

The outer curves contrast with the angled inner counter shapes, which distributes feelings of strength and softness at the same time. 
Athiti can be used with a mixture of formal and informal content, for example in educational work.

A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts.

Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to the formal looped style, and this allows type designers to extend loopless families to very black weights.
Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
Also, in this case, ink trapping is required when connecting two specific strokes of each glyph, and it has to be done carefully, as it has been in Athiti.
