Economica is the first digital typeface created in Montevideo, Uruguay, to be distributed internationally. 
</p> 
<p>
Economica has four basic styles: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic. 
It includes a comprehensive character set that lets you work with diverse European languages.
</p> 
<p>
This typeface family was designed for the output of inkjet printers. 
It was inspired by the concept of saving space in publishing texts without loss of height. This means it is a very condensed type.
</p> 
<p>
The visual advantage of Economica is that it accomplishes this horizontal compression while keeping a strong personality. 
It is not a typical, neutral, sans serif. The open forms and tendency towards flattened curves allow it to be used in very small 
spaces while retaining high legibility.
