Aguafina Script exudes semi-formal and eye-catching elegance.

Graceful, but not too casual. Knowledgeable and artistic, but not too imposing. 
The characters flow into each other, making for a very striking script. 
The narrow lowercase allows for efficient use of space, while the long ascenders and descenders help maintain the legibility.
