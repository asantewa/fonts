Pecita is a font that was created from the designer’s handwriting. 
The raw material of Pecita is a scan of the designer’s handwriting with its flaws and charms. 
The font is available as OpenType (.OTF) from <a href="http://pecita.eu">pecita.eu</a>. 
It is coded with full Unicode glyphs customary in Latin and pan European languages, the phonetic alphabet, katakana, and many symbols. 
It includes many ligatures.
</p>
<p>Version 2.5 represents the achievement of key objectives: all the Latin characters used
nowadays, katakana, all Unicode characters up to 0 × 02AF, ligatures enough for
a realistic handwritten record.
