Rye's bold attention-grabbing shapes are useful for advertising. 
Rye is a medium contrast design inspired by posters using wood type. 
It gives off a feeling of the American West. 
It is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. 
This font was made specifically to be used as a web type.
