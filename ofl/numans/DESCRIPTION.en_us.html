Numans font is a modern 'grotesque' sans-serif with open forms. 
The designer, Jovanny Lemonad – a Russian whose English is not very fluent, sometimes confused “Humans” with “Numans”. 
The name was birthed from this confusion.
Numans is similar to the more bold font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Days+One">Days One</a>, 
also available in Google Web Fonts.
