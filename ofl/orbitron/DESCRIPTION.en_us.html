Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes. 
It was designed with the assumption of being in a futuristic world setting, in which the aftermath of an apocalypse has resulted in the loss 
of all fonts, calling for the need of alternatives to typefaces like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. 
In this futuristic scenario, Orbitron will be used on spaceship exteriors, space station signage, monopolistic corporate branding, 
uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads etc. 
It can also be used for futuristic movie posters. 
Orbitron was initially published on the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com">League of Movable Type</a>.
