<p>&quot;Yanone Kaffeesatz&quot; was first published in 2004.
It is a typeface that balances angular and curved edges well. It has varying weights – each conveying a different personality. 
Its Bold is reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography, while the rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present times. 
Works best in advertising designs, billboards, publishing and signage</p> 
<p>The typeface has been reworked and published in FontShop’s <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/index.ep?aid=28">FontFont Library</a> under the 
new name <a href="http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kava/">FF Kava</a>. 
  
<p>Updated in December 2013 with Cyrillic, designed by Sol Matas and Juan Pablo del Peral at 
<a href="http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar">Huerta Tipográfica</a>.</p>
