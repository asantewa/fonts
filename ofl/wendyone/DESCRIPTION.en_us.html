<p>Wendy is loosely inspired by the STABILO logotype, a brand that works as a
conceptual and aesthetic reference. For designer Alejandro Inler, it evoked in him  design values, form and
style.</p>

<p>The challenge was to take a logotype consisting of seven letters as a starting point to develop an alphabet. 
He liked the idea of the original logo for the beauty of its forms: original and risky and took on the challenge to continue 
the work of someone whose development was arrested at another time. 
To animate these characters, giving them new life through the design of a typeface that finds the balance between the old and new forms.</p>

<p>The font was developed by Alejandro Inler in conjunction with Julieta
Ulanovsky.</p>
