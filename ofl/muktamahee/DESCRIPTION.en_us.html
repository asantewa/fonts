Mukta Mahee belongs to the Mukta family - a Unicode compliant, versatile, contemporary, humanist, mono-linear typeface family available in seven weights, 
supporting Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Tamil and Latin scripts.
This type family is a libre licensed version of Ek's self-titled multi-script project.
The goal is to build one harmonious family across all Indian scripts without letting the visual features of one script dominate over others.
This ensures that the fonts can be used successfully for both single and multi-script purposes.

<p>Mukta Mahee was designed by Shuchita Grover and Noopur Datye. The other fonts in the family are:
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta">Mukta</a> 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta+Vaani">Mukta Vaani</a> and
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mukta+Malar">Mukta Malar</a>
