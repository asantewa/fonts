Changa is a typeface family intended intended for headlines, titles and other display settings.
It supports the Latin and Arabic scripts.

<p>
The Latin was developed with a singular height so that you can create display texts with minimum line spacing. 
The lowercase has short ascenders and descenders and the letters are inscribed within a square. 
The uppercase is also sturdy and squat. The counter shapes are rectangular, 
featuring small curves in opposite vertexes which accompany and break the shapes, evoking a contemporary style.

intended for display usage.

The Arabic was also drawn by Eduardo Tunni, in Buenos Aires, in collaboration with M. Gaber in Cairo.
