Roboto sans serif has an impeccable uniformity with a good dose of easiness. 
It’s a dual-natured type of the sans serif family that is mechanical, and at the same time features friendly and open curves.   
The font doesn’t distort its form to force a rigid rhythm, instead the letters settle into their natural width. 
This aids in legibility and gives it a harmonious rhythm that works well for both text and headlines

This is the regular family, which can be used alongside the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Condensed">Roboto Condensed</a> family and the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab">Roboto Slab</a> family.
