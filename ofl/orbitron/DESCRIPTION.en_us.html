Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes. Orbitron was designed with the intention of giving graphic designers 
set in the future, alternatives to typefaces like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. 
In futuristic sci-fi movies, the aftermath of an apocalypse can result in the loss of all other fonts. 
Only few geometric typefaces will have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, space station signage, 
monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads etc. 
Orbitron can also be used for futuristic movie posters.
It was initially published on the <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com">League of Movable Type</a>.

<p>Orbitron was remastered as a variable font in 2019. To contribute updates or file issues, see <a href="https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron">https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron</a>.</p>
