Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish).

The inspiration for Lato was to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities. 
Lukasz wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits 
when used in larger sizes.

He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. 
At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010 — even though it does not follow any current trend.
The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. 
“Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.

<b>Update, August 2014</b>: The previous version of Lato included Extended Latin characters in the Latin subset. 
If you are experiencing problems, please select the Extended Latin (latin-ext) subset to render all European languages correctly.
