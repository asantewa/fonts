A dotted version of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">Raleway</a>, for posters and big headlines.

Raleway Dots is a display face which features both old style and lining
numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of
diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric
sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character
set.
