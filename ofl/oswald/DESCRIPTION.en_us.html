Oswald is a sans serif typeface that is synonymous to well-honed and acutely refined. 
Every curve and angle of the letterform is finely adjusted to give it a visual balance that makes for pleasant reading.

From advertising and packaging to editorial and publishing â€“ it is a typeface intended for a range of uses. 
=======
Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014.
Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback.
In 2016 the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar and Alexei Vanyashin to complete the work started by Vernon, and support languages that use the Cyrillic script.
In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis.
