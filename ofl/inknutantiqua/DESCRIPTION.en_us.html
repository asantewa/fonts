Inknut Antiqua is an Antiqua typeface for literature and long-form text.
Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_press" target="_blank">private press</a>, 
it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition.
</p>
<p> 
The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens.

<p>
The Inknut Antiqua project is led by Claus Eggers SÃ¸rensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam.
