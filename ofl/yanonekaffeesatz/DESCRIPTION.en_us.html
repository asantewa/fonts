<p>&quot;Yanone Kaffeesatz&quot; was first published in 2004 and is Yanone’s first ever finished typeface. 
It is a typeface that balances angular and curved edges well. Its Bold is reminiscent of 1920s coffee house typography, 
while the rather thin fonts bridge the gap to present times. It has been downloaded over 100,000 times to date, 
and you can witness Kaffeesatz use on German fresh-water gyms, Dubai mall promos and New Zealand McDonalds ads. 
And of course on coffee and foodstuff packaging and café design around the globe.
It has varying weights – each conveying a different personality. Works best in advertising designs, billboards, publishing and signage.</p> 
<p>In 2009 he reworked much of the typeface and it got published in FontShop’s <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/index.ep?aid=28">FontFont Library</a> 
under the new name <a href="http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kava/">FF Kava</a>.

<p>Updated in December 2013 with Cyrillic, designed by Sol Matas and Juan Pablo del Peral at
