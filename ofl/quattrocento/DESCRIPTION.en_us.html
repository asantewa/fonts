<p>The Quattrocento Roman typeface is a Classic, Elegant, Sober and Strong typeface.</p> 
<p>The wide and open letterforms, and the great x-height, make it very legible for body text at small sizes. 
All the tiny details that only show up at bigger sizes also make it great for display use.</p> 
<p>Some of the type's distinctive characteristics are:</p> <ul> <li>Low Contrast. 
The thins are just a tad thiner than the thicks, almost monotone.
</li> <li>Cupped, tapered stems that flows naturally into the serifs.</li> <li>Distinctive K, R and & tail.
</li> <li>Cupped B, D, E, F, P, Q, R and T.</li> <li>The Q is a humble expression of admiration and gratitude for Doyald Young.
</li> <li>Alternate M, Two W alternates .</li> <li>Narrow L, T for better fit.</li> <li>Almost flat top serif on the lowercases.
</li> <li>Shoulders of the m and n rise above the serif.</li> <li>Serif-less bottom j and y.</li> </ul>

<p>It has a <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quattrocento+Sans">Sans</a> companion that complements it well.</p>
