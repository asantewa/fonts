The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection is an intriguing reminder of the heady days of hand lettering and calligraphy in the United States. 
The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created by Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - 
is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.
