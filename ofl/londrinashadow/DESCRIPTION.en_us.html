The Londrina super family is composed of 4 family styles: 
<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Solid">Londrina Solid</a>, 
Londrina Shadow, 
<a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Londrina+Outline">Londrina Outline</a>, 
and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Londrina+Sketch">Londrina Sketch</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Londrina Shadow has a somewhat three-dimensional feel to it and can be combined with the main style to create different effects.

The origins of the Londrina typeface project is in the streets of Sao Paulo, Brazil: Urban confusion. 
Initially designed for use in a poster, with only uppercase letters, the potential for it to be a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing
used day-to-day in Sao Pauloâ€™s informal communication, developed the font into a typeface family with lowercases too. 
The variety in texture allows you to create different projects from posters to magazines and t-shirts etc.
