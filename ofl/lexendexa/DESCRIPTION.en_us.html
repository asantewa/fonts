<p>Lexend is a collection of font families empirically shown to significantly improve reading-proficiency. As prescription eyeglasses achieve proficiency for persons with short-sightedness, Lexend's families were developed using <a href="https://revreading.org/wp-opt-perf/">Shaver-Troup Formulations.</a></p>

<p>This is the Exa family. In total there are seven sibling families, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Regular">Regular</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Kilo">Kilo</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Mega">Mega</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Giga">Giga</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Tera">Tera</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Peta">Peta</a>.</p>

<p>We will eventually release all seven families as a single variable font.</p>
