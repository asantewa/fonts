Dawning of a New Day is based on the handwriting of designer Kimberly Gesweinâ€™s friend. 
The title was chosen by the friend, but also had great meaning to her. 
The desire is for the light, fluid motions of this script to mimic the hopeful feeling of each new day as a chance to start afresh, 
- free from past mistakes
