Geostar is a great font for large headlines on websites. 
Its single weight allows for easy legibility and captivates the audience at first glance. 
Because Geostar is so symmetrical, it is a fantastic option to add charisma and sophistication to any web page.
It has a sister family <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geostar+Fill">Geostar Fill</a> which complements it well.
