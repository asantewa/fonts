Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface with a high x-height that improves legibility for long blocks of text. 
It was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance that makes for better legibility. 
It is a good choice for print, web design, and mobile interfaces.
