<p>Delius is a high quality comic book lettering typeface super-family. It is made up of three families; 
Delis, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Delius+Unicase">Delius Unicase</a> and 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Delius+Swash+Caps">Delius Swash Caps.</a></p> 
<p>A round marker was used to define Delius's stroke: the line gets thicker at both ends to define the beginning and end of the stroke, 
as a marker line would do, and the ductus imitates the movements of handwriting.</p>
