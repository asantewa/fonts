A revival of Frederic Goudy's ‘Goudy Oldstyle' – adopting his archaic approach of the oldstyle serif typeface that has never gone out of style; 
Sort Mills Goudy comes with Regular and Italic styles, and extended Latin character coverage. 
With round curves and thin strokes, it gives flair to an otherwise formal document, and is suitable for both body text and display purposes.
